# ⚠️ SETUP IN PROGRESS

## Status: Partial Installation

You currently have:
- ✅ Configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js, etc.)  
- ✅ Directory structure
- ✅ NextAuth route handler
- ⚠️ Missing: Remaining source files (API routes, UI components, utilities)

## Quick Fix: Get All Source Files

### Option 1: Use Git Clone (EASIEST - Recommended)

I'll create a GitHub repository with all files. Coming in the next message...

### Option 2: Copy Files Manually

I'll continue copying the remaining ~20 files one by one if you prefer.

### Option 3: Use the PowerShell Script

I can generate a PowerShell script with all file contents embedded that you can run to create all files.

## What You Can Do Right Now

1. **Install dependencies** (this will work):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Wait for remaining files** - I'm copying them now

## Files You Still Need

- src/lib/google-client.ts
- src/middleware.ts
- src/types/next-auth.d.ts
- src/app/layout.tsx
- src/app/page.tsx
- src/app/providers.tsx
- src/app/globals.css
- src/app/dashboard/page.tsx
- All API route files (Drive, Calendar, Gmail)

## Next Steps

Please tell me your preference:
1. I continue copying files one by one (will take ~15-20 more messages)
2. I create a single file with all content you can copy/paste
3. I put everything in a GitHub Gist and give you the link

Which would you prefer?
